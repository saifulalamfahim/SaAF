            <div className='About-details'>
                <p>Since beginning my journey as a presentation designer using “Office Powerpoint” over 3 years ago. then I learned other <br /> designing tools like<span className='highlight-text'>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Figma,</span> etc. And done some beautiful projects using these <br /> tools. <br />
                
                
                
                after that, I’m curious about “<span className='highlight-text hudai'>Frontend Designing and building user interface</span> ”So as much as <br /> possible I started to learn to code. First of all, I learned “ <span className='highlight-text'>HTML & CSS</span> ”and some <span className='highlight-text'>CSS frameworks like <br /> Bootstrap, tailwind CSS,</span> etc. then I realized these tools are not enough for “ <span className='hudai'>frontend development</span> ”So I started <br /> my journey with <span className='highlight-text hudai'>JavaScript and some JS frameworks like ReactJS, TypeScript,</span> etc, Since last <br />2 years I built some beutifull local and my website project for practice. (Scroll below to see my project) <br /> 
                Now, Finally, I’m ready to start my journey with you.<br />
                Trust me, I’ll do the best things for you!</p>
                <p>Thanks</p>
