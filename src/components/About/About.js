            <div className='About-details'>
                <p>Since begining my journey as a presentation designer using “Office Powerpoint”over 3 years ago. then i learned another <br /> designing tools like, <span className='highlight-text'>Adobe Photoshop, Adobe XD, Figma</span> etc. And done some beutifull project using this <br /> tools. <br />
                
                
                
                fter that i’m curios about “<span className='highlight-text hudai'>Frontend Designing and building user interface</span> ”So as much as <br /> possible i started to learn coding. First of all, I learned “ <span className='highlight-text'>HTML & CSS</span> ”and some <span className='highlight-text'>CSS framework like <br /> Bootstrap, tailwind CSS</span> etc. then I realized these too;s are not enough for “ <span className='hudai'>frontend development</span> ”So I started <br /> my journey with <span className='highlight-text hudai'>javaScript and some JS framework like ReactJS, TypeScript</span> etc, Since last <br /> 2 years I built some beutifull local and my own website project for practice.
